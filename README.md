# EyeTrackVR-Hardware

---It's incomplete!!!!!!!---

There's only a guber file in the EyeTrackVR project, and there's a blank space where the guber file is probably for using SMD automation machines
I tried to modify it because it was an unnecessary waste of money for manual users, but it was difficult to modify because there was only a governor file, so I made it similarly.
We tried our best to make it similar, but it did not guarantee normal operation, and we cannot guarantee that the original project and the part's location or the PCB's shape are 100% consistent. 
If you want to do something based on this project, please be aware of this

Hardware files for EyeTrackVR

This includes camera mounts, ESP mounts, PCB files and all other things hardware releated.
